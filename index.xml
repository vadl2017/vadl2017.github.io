      <description>Recently, deep neural networks have been achieving breakthroughs in various major artificial intelligence tasks such as machine translation, image understanding, speech recognition, and so on. In these tasks, deep neural networks reached the level of an accuracy comparable to or even better than humansâ€™ performance.
The primary goal of the workshop is to bridge the gap by bringing together researchers from both machine learning and visual analytics fields, which allows us to push the boundary of deep learning.</description>
